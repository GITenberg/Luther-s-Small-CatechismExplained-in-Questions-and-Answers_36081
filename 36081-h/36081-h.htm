<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In 1897 the present publishers issued in Norwegian an Explanation
of Luther's Small Catechism by Pastor H. U. Sverdrup,
being an abridged edition of a larger work by the same
author, based on Dr. Pontoppidan's Explanation of the Catechism.
Some alterations were made in the answers to questions
244&ndash;252. The present work is a translation of this
abridged and slightly altered edition.</p>

<p>A literal translation has been avoided rather than sought;
an attempt has been made to render the original in the simplest
and strongest English, and to avoid words and expressions
with which the young are little familiar.</p>

<p>In the catechism proper the Standard English Catechism
Version has been followed when it did not interfere with the
plan stated above. But departures have been made reluctantly
and only when simplicity and clearness seemed to be gained
thereby. It is not thought that these few changes will cause
any disturbance.</p>

<p>Scripture quotations have been added somewhat freely
from the larger edition.</p>

<p>As the needs of our English speaking young people have
been constantly borne in mind during the preparation of this
translation, it is hoped that the book may not fail to carry
some blessing to them.</p>

<h3>PART ONE.</h3>
<h2>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</h2>
<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FIRST COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear, love, and trust in God above
all things.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE SECOND COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy
God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless
that taketh his name in vain.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not curse,
swear, conjure, lie, or deceive by His name, but
call upon His name in every time of need, and
worship Him with prayer, praise, and thanksgiving.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE THIRD COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not despise
or neglect His Word, but deem it holy and gladly
hear and learn it.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Honor thy father and thy mother, that it may
be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the
earth.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not despise
or give offense to our parents or superiors;
but honor, serve, obey, love, and esteem them.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not kill.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not hurt
or harm our neighbor in his body, but help and
befriend him in all bodily distress.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and live a
chaste and pure life, in words and deeds, husband
and wife loving and honoring each other.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not steal.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not take
our neighbor's money or property, nor get it
by unfair dealing or other dishonesty, but help
him to improve and protect his property and
living.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbor.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not tell
lies about our neighbor, nor betray, slander, or
defame him; but excuse him, speak well of him,
and look upon all his acts as well-meant.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE NINTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not by
deceit or craft seek to gain our neighbor's inheritance
or home, nor try to get it though we
seem to have some right thereto, but help him
to keep his own.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE TENTH COMMANDMENT.</h4>

<p><b>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor
his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his cattle,
nor anything that is his.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not
estrange, force, or entice away from our neighbor,
his wife, servants, or cattle, but urge them
to stay and do their duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What does God say of all his commandments?</i></p></div>

<p><b>I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me;
and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love
me, and keep my commandments.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>God threatens to punish all who transgress
these commandments; we should therefore fear
His wrath, and do nothing against them.</p>

<p>On the other hand He promises grace and
every blessing to all who keep these commandments;
we should therefore love Him and trust
in Him, and gladly do according to His commandments.</p>

<h3>PART TWO.</h3>
<h2>THE THREE ARTICLES OF THE CREED.</h2>
<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FIRST ARTICLE.</h4>
<h3>CONCERNING CREATION.</h3>

<p><b>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of
heaven and earth.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>I believe that God has made me and all
other creatures; that He has given me body and
soul, eyes, ears, and all other members, my reason,
and all my senses.</p>

<p>I also believe that He preserves all He has
made, and that He daily provides me with all
I need, giving me clothing and food, home and
family, and every good thing.</p>

<p>I further believe that He protects me from
all danger, and keeps me from all evil; not because
I have deserved it, but because He is a
loving and merciful Father.</p>

<p>For all these blessings it is my duty to
serve Him thankfully and obediently all the days
of my life.</p>

<p>All this is certainly true.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE SECOND ARTICLE.</h4>
<h3>CONCERNING REDEMPTION.</h3>

<p><b>I believe in Jesus Christ His only Son, our Lord;
who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the
Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified,
dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the
third day He arose again from the dead; He ascended
into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God
the Father Almighty; from whence He shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>I believe that Jesus Christ is true God, begotten
of the Father from eternity; I also believe
that He is true man, born of the Virgin Mary;
that He is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a
lost and condemned sinner; who has freed me
from sin, from death, and from the power of
Satan, not with gold or silver but with His holy
and precious blood and His innocent death.</p>

<p>All this He has done that I might be His
own, and that I might serve Him in righteousness,
innocence, and happiness, and live and reign
with Him in His kingdom forever, even as He
arose from the dead, lives and reigns through
all eternity.</p>

<p>All this is certainly true.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE THIRD ARTICLE.</h4>
<h3>CONCERNING SANCTIFICATION.</h3>

<p><b>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Christian
church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of
sins; the resurrection of the body; and life everlasting.
Amen.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>I believe that I cannot through my own
strength believe in Jesus Christ my Lord, or
come to Him. This is the work of the Holy
Spirit alone, who has called me through the
gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, and sanctified
and preserved me in the true faith;</p>

<p>Even as he calls, gathers, enlightens, and
sanctifies the whole Christian church on earth,
and preserves it in fellowship with Jesus Christ
in the one true faith.</p>

<p>In this Christian church He daily forgives
me and all believers all our sins, and He will
raise up me and all the dead on the last day,
and will give me and all believers everlasting life.</p>

<p>All this is certainly true.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>
<h3>PART THREE.</h3>
<h2>THE LORD'S PRAYER.</h2>

<p><b>Our Father who art in heaven.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>God would hereby tenderly invite us to believe
that He is truly our Father, and we are
truly His children, so that we may ask of Him
with all cheerfulness and confidence, as dear
children ask of their dear father.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FIRST PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>Hallowed be Thy name.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>The name of God is indeed holy in itself;
but we pray in this petition that it may be
hallowed also among us.</p>

<p>This is done when the Word of God is rightly
taught, and when we as the children of God live
holy lives in obedience to the Word. This grant
us, heavenly Father.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE SECOND PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>Thy kingdom come.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>The kingdom of God comes indeed of itself,
without our prayer, but we pray in this petition
that it may come also to us.</p>

<p>This is done when our heavenly Father gives
us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe
the Word of God, and live holy and Christ-like
lives here in time, and in heaven forever.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE THIRD PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>The good and gracious will of God is done
indeed without our prayer; but we pray in this
petition that it may be done also among us.</p>

<p>This is done when God brings to nothing
all evil plans and purposes of the devil, the
world, and our own flesh, that would hinder
the hallowing of His name and the coming of
His kingdom.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is the good and gracious
will of God to strengthen us and keep us
steadfast in His Word and in faith, until death.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE FOURTH PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>Give us this day our daily bread.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>God gives daily bread indeed without our
prayer even to the wicked; but we pray in this
petition that He would help us to appreciate
His benefits, that we may receive our daily bread
with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>By daily bread is meant all those things
which are needed for our support and well-being
in life, as food and clothing, home and property,
happy family relations, a good government,
favorable weather, peace and health, faithful
friends, good neighbors, and the like.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE FIFTH PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive
those who trespass against us.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We pray in this petition that our Father in
heaven would not look upon our sins, nor, on
account of them, deny our prayer, for we are
not worthy of anything we ask, neither have
we deserved it; but we pray that He would
give it to us out of His mercy; for we sin every
day, and deserve nothing but punishment.</p>

<p>And we on our part will heartily forgive
those who have sinned against us, and return
good for evil.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span></p>
<h4>THE SIXTH PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>And lead us not into temptation.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>God indeed tempts no one, but we pray in
this petition that He would guard and keep us
from the devil, the world, and our own flesh,
that we fall not, through their deceit, into unbelief,
despair, or other sins; but we pray that
although we be thus tempted, we may overcome
the temptation, and remain victorious.</p>


<hr class="hr2" />
<h4>THE SEVENTH PETITION.</h4>

<p><b>But deliver us from evil.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We pray in this petition, in general, that
our Father in heaven would deliver us from all
evil, affecting body and soul, property and honor,
and at last grant us a blessed end, and graciously
take us from this world of sorrow to
Himself in heaven.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What are the closing words of the Lord's Prayer?</i></p></div>

<p><b>For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should remember that God is able to
answer our prayer, and that the glory belongs
to Him alone, when we get according to our
prayer.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>Why is the word "Amen" added?</i></p></div>

<p>It is added in order that I may be fully assured
that these petitions are acceptable to our
Father in heaven, and are heard by Him.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span></p>
<h3>PART FOUR.</h3>
<h2>THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>What is Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Baptism is not water alone, but it is water
comprehended in God's command, and united
with His Word.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What is God's command concerning Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>It is given in the words of Christ in the last
chapter of Matthew:</p>

<p><b>"Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost."</b></p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What benefit do we have from Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Baptism works the forgiveness of sins, delivers
from death and the devil, and gives everlasting
life to all who believe what the Word
and promises of God declare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What is God's promise concerning Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>It is given in the words of Christ in the
sixteenth chapter of Mark:</p>

<p><b>"He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
but he that believeth not shall be condemned."</b></p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>How can water do such great things?</i></p></div>

<p>It is not water indeed that does it, but the
Word of God, which is in and with the water,
and faith which trusts this Word of God in the
water.</p>

<p>For without the Word of God, the water
is water alone, and no Baptism. But with the
Word of God it is a Baptism, that is, a gracious
water of life and a washing of regeneration in
the Holy Ghost; as Paul says in the third chapter
of the epistle to Titus:</p>

<p>"According to His mercy He saved us, by
the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost; which He shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Savior; that being justified
by His grace, we should be made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life."</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What does the baptizing with water signify?</i></p></div>

<p>It signifies that the old man in us should,
by daily sorrow and repentance, be drowned
and die, with all sins and evil desires; and again
a new man daily appear more and more, who
shall live before God in righteousness and purity
forever.</p>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>
<h3>PART FIVE.</h3>
<h2>THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>What is the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>It is the true body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, under bread and wine, instituted
by Christ Himself for Christians to eat and to
drink.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>Repeat the Words of Institution.</i></p></div>

<p><b>"Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the night in which
He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given
thanks, He brake it and gave it to His disciples, saying,
Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for
you; this do in remembrance of me.</b></p>

<p><b>"After the same manner, also, when He had
supped, He took the cup, and when He had given
thanks, He gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of
it; this cup is the New Testament in my blood, which
is shed for you, and for many, for the remission of
sins; this do, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance
of me."</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>What benefit do we have from the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>It is shown by these words: "Given and
shed for you, for the remission of sins;" namely,
that in the sacrament forgiveness of sins, life,
and salvation are given us through these words.
For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is
also life and salvation.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>How can bodily eating and drinking do such great things?</i></p></div>

<p>It is not the eating and drinking, indeed,
that does it, but the words which stand here:
"Given and shed for you, for the remission of
sins." These words, together with the bodily
eating and drinking, are the chief thing in the
sacrament; and He that believes these words,
has what they say and mean, namely, the forgiveness
of sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>Who, then, receive this sacrament worthily?</i></p></div>

<p>Fasting and bodily preparation are indeed
a good outward practise;</p>

<p>But he alone is truly worthy and well prepared,
who believes these words: "Given and shed
for you, for the remission of sins."</p>

<p>But he who believes not these words is unworthy
and unprepared. The words, "<b>for you</b>"
require truly believing hearts.</p>

<h3>PART ONE.</h3>
<h2>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, OR THE LAW.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>13. How has God given His law to us?</i></p></div>

<p>1. In the creation God wrote His Law in
the heart of man. (Conscience.) Rom. 2:15.</p>

<p>2. At Mount Sinai He gave His Law in the
Ten Commandments, written on two tables of
stone. Ex. 20:1&ndash;17.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>14. Does this Law demand outward observance only?</i></p></div>

<p>No; it demands the whole man, and the willing
obedience of heart and mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Luk. 10:27. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>15. Can we be saved through the Law?</i></p></div>

<p>No; since the fall in sin no man can perfectly
keep the Law.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 8:7. The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject
to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.</b></p></div>

of God toward sin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
    2. It makes us anxious to seek Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Gal. 3:24. The law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ.</b></p></div>

<p>3. It points out to the believer what fruits
his faith must bear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Ps. 119:105. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my
path.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>17. What is the substance of the law?</i></p></div>

<p>Love to God, ourselves, and our neighbor.
Matt. 22:37&ndash;40.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 13:10. [R. V.] Love is the fulfilment of the law.</b></p>

<p><b>1 Tim. 1:5. [R. V.] But the end of the charge is love out of a pure
heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>31. When do we love God?</i></p></div>

that taketh his name in vain.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We should fear and love God, and not curse,
swear, conjure, lie, or deceive by His name, but
call upon His name in every time of need, and
worship Him with prayer, praise, and thanksgiving.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>38. What is meant by the "name" of God?</i></p></div>

<p>1. The usual names given to Him in the
Bible.</p>

<p>2. His nature and attributes and all that

Word, sacraments, and works.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>39. When is the name of God taken in vain?</i></p></div>

<p>When it is used in a thoughtless and mocking
manner and without devotion and reverence.</p>

<p>1. When we use God's name or Word in
jesting or as a by-word.</p>

<p>2. When we find fault with anything God
has done.</p>

<p>3. When we use the name of God in cursing,
swearing, conjuring, lying, or deceiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>41. What is it to curse by the name of God?</i></p></div>

<p>It is to call down evil upon ourselves, our
neighbor, or any other created thing, by the
name of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>42. What is it to swear by the name of God?</i></p></div>

<p>It is to bear witness to anything by the
holy name of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>43. Are we never permitted to swear?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; when the proper authorities demand it
in God's stead.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>44. Why is it a great sin to commit perjury?</i></p></div>

<p>Because the perjurer shows open disregard for
God and the salvation of his own soul, and frankly
calls down the judgment of God upon himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>45. Are cursing and swearing sinful when the name of God is
not used?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes, indeed; for whatever we curse or swear
by, we really do so by God who is the Lord of
all things.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 5:34&ndash;37. Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's
throne:</b></p>

<p><b>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is
the city of the great King.</b></p>

<p><b>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one
hair white or black.</b></p>

<p><b>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.</b></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>46. Are cursing and swearing sinful when they have become a
habit?</i></p></div>

<p>Most certainly; for a sinful habit proves that
sin is our master.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>47. What is it to conjure by the name of God?</i></p></div>

<p>It is trying to cure diseases, or to practice
any other kind of superstition, by the name of
God or a passage from the Bible.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>48. How do we lie and deceive by the name of God?</i></p></div>

<p>By perjury, false teaching, and hypocrisy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 15:9. In vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</b></p>

<p><b>Titus 1:16. They profess that they know God; but by their works
they deny Him.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>49. What must he expect who takes the name of God in vain?</i></p></div>

<p>Great punishment, both in time and eternity;
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>54. How do we misuse the day of rest?</i></p></div>

of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Eccl. 5:1. Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.</b></p></div>

<p>2. When we do work or take part in amusements
that either are actually sinful or turn our
minds away from God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>55. Is no work permitted on Sunday?</i></p></div>

<p><b>I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker
of heaven and earth.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>I believe that God has made me and all
other creatures; that He has given me body and
soul, eyes, ears, and all other members, my reason,

<p>I also believe that He preserves all He has
made, and that He daily provides me with all
I need; giving me clothing and food, home and
family, and every good thing.</p>

all danger, and keeps me from all evil; not because
I have deserved it, but because He is a

<p>For all these blessings it is my duty to
serve Him thankfully and obediently all the days

sorrowful unto death"; and on the cross, when
He cried, "My God, my God, why hast Thou
forsaken me?"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Isa. 53:4, 5. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows:</b></p>

<p><b>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:

we are healed.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>182. How did Christ act through all this suffering?</i></p></div>

<p>He was patient as a lamb that is lead to
the slaughter. Isa. 53:7.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>183. What did Christ accomplish for us by His death on the
cross?</i></p></div>

<p>By His death He has paid the wages of
sin, which is death.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 5:10. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of his Son.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>184. What comfort do we have from the burial of Christ?</i></p></div>

patience in suffering.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Pet. 2:21. Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that
ye should follow His steps.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>186. Did Christ remain in humiliation and death?</i></p></div>

<p>No; God exalted Him and gave Him a name
which is above every name. Phil. 2:9.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>187. How many steps do you notice in the exaltation of
Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>Five: His descent into hell; His resurrection;
His ascension; His session at the right hand of

the dead.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>188. What did Christ accomplish when he descended into hell?</i></p></div>

<p>He made known the victory which He had
won over the devil, and preached to the spirits

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>189. What benefit do we have from the resurrection of Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>1. The resurrection assures us that Christ
is the Son of God, and that He has conquered
death and fully satisfied for our sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 1:4. Declared to be the Son of God by the resurrection from the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>

Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>191. What is meant by the ascension of Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>He left the earth, so that He is no longer
visibly present, and He entered into His Father's
glory to prepare a place for us in the heavenly
mansions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 14:2. In my Father's house are many mansions; I go to prepare
a place for you.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>192. What does the ascension of Christ teach us?</i></p></div>

<p>It teaches us to be heavenly-minded, and to
have a desire to depart and be with Christ.</p>

all things.</p>

<h3>CONCERNING SANCTIFICATION.</h3>

<p><b>I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy Christian

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>I believe that I cannot through my own
strength believe in Jesus Christ my Lord, or
come to Him. This is the work of the Holy
Spirit alone, who has called me through the
gospel, enlightened me with His gifts, and sanctified

<p>Even as He calls, gathers, enlightens, and

raise up me and all the dead on the last day,
and will give me and all believers everlasting life.</p>

<p>All this is certainly true.</p>

<p>The Holy Ghost is true God together with
the Father and the Son.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 2:10. The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.</b></p>

<p><b>1 Cor. 3:16. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>201. What is the work of the Holy Spirit?</i></p></div>

<p>To call, enlighten, sanctify, and preserve.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>202. How does the Holy Spirit call us?</i></p></div>

<p>The Holy Spirit calls us by awakening in
our hearts a deep sense of sin, and by inviting
us to accept the grace of God in Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Eph. 5:14. Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and
Christ shall give thee light.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>203. By what means does the Holy Spirit call us?</i></p></div>

<p>By the Word of God; using the law to awaken
our hearts, and the gospel to invite us to Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 3:20. By the law is the knowledge of sin.</b></p>

<p><b>Matt. 22:1&ndash;14.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>204. What means does God use to make us heed the call of
the Holy Spirit?</i></p></div>

<p>To this end He often uses suffering, often
blessings, often the example of others, and such
other means as may lead us to reflect.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>205. Do all obey the call of the Holy Spirit?</i></p></div>

<p>No; many resist the Holy Spirit, and will
not repent and come to Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Acts 7:51. Ye do always resist the Holy Ghost.</b></p>

<p><b>Isa. 65:2. I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious
people.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>206. When does a person harden his heart?</i></p></div>

<p>A person hardens his heart when he persistently
despises and opposes the voice of the Holy
Spirit in his conscience.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>207. Who obey the call of the Holy Spirit?</i></p></div>

<p>They who repent their sins and believe the
Gospel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Mark. 1:15. The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:
repent ye, and believe the gospel.</b></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>208. What is it to repent?</i></p></div>

<p>He who truly repents, feels his sins with
shame and sorrow, he freely confesses his sins
to God, and earnestly seeks the grace of God in
Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Isa. 55:7. Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon
him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.</b></p>

<p><b>2 Cor. 7:10. [R. V.] Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation,
a repentance which bringeth no regret: but the sorrow of the world worketh
death.</b></p>

<p><b>Ps. 32:5. I acknowledged my sin unto thee; and thou forgavest the
iniquity of my sin.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>209. How do we learn that the grace of God is found in Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>We learn this through the enlightenment of
the Holy Spirit.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>210. What is meant by the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit?</i></p></div>

<p>Through the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit
our knowledge of the Gospel truths becomes a
living and saving knowledge to our hearts.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 14:26. But the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father
will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to
your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</b></p>

<p><b>John 16:13. When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>211. Of what nature is our knowledge of these truths before
the Holy Spirit has enlightened our hearts?</i></p></div>

<p>It is a dead knowledge only, which does not
lead to repentance and faith, but leaves us in
our sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>212. What is the true and living faith in Jesus Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>This is faith, that a repentant sinner lays
hold of Christ as his only Savior from sin, and
death, and the power of Satan;</p>

<p>That he takes refuge with Christ and His
righteousness, and builds thereon with the confidence
of his whole heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>213. Can only a repentant sinner have this faith in Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; the faith which lays hold of Christ and
His righteousness, can be wrought in that heart
only which bitterly feels the pain and misery
of living in sin.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 9:12. They that be whole need not a physician, but they that
are sick.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>214. Is the true and living faith always and in all persons
equally strong?</i></p></div>

<p>No; it is often very weak and scarcely able
to avail itself of the grace of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Mark 9:24. Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>215. Whereby may we know whether this weak faith is true
and living?</i></p></div>

<p>The true and living faith is known by an
earnest hatred of sin, and an eager longing for
grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>216. Does God accept this weak faith?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes, indeed; only it be true and sincere.</p>

shall he not quench.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>217. What benefit do we have from the true and living faith
in Jesus Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>By faith we are justified, born anew, sanctified,
and finally saved forever.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>218. What is Justification?</i></p></div>

<p>Justification is the gracious act of God whereby
He for Christ's sake acquits a repentant and
believing sinner of his sin and guilt, and looks
upon him, in Christ, as though he had never
sinned.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>2 Cor. 5:21. For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin
that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</b></p>

<p><b>Rom. 3:24. (They are) justified freely by his grace through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>219. What, then, does the believer receive through justification?</i></p></div>

<p>He receives the forgiveness of sins, and is
adopted as a child of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Eph. 1:7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
of sins, according to the riches of his grace.</b></p>

<p><b>Gal. 3:26. For ye are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</b></p>

<p><b>Acts 10:43. To him give all the prophets witness, that through his
name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>220. What moves God to forgive sin so freely?</i></p></div>

<p>His everlasting love and mercy alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>221. For whose sake does God forgive us our sins?</i></p></div>

<p>For Christ's sake, who has satisfied for the
sins of the whole world by His death on the
cross.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 1:29. Behold the lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
the world.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>222. To what does the forgiveness of sins necessarily lead?</i></p></div>

<p>The forgiveness of sins leads to the full enjoyment
of the blessed rights which belong to
a child of God; it also gives free access to the
Father's fellowship and blessing, and to the
glorious inheritance of eternal life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Ps. 32:1, 2. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin
is covered.</b></p>

<p><b>Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
whose spirit there is no guile.</b></p>

<p><b>Rom. 8:17. And if [we are] children, then heirs; heirs of God, and
joint-heirs with Christ.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>223. What is the New Birth?</i></p></div>

<p>The New Birth is the gracious work of the
Holy Spirit whereby He, through His indwelling
in our hearts, renews the image of God in us,
and thus creates a new spiritual man.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>2 Cor. 5:17. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things
have passed away; behold, all things are new.</b></p>

<p><b>John 1:12, 13. But as many as received him, to them gave he power
to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</b></p>

<p><b>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>224. What change is wrought in us in the New Birth?</i></p></div>

<p>We get a new heart or a new spiritual life;
namely,</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the conscience, real peace and joy;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the will, a holy desire and a steadfast purpose.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Ezek. 36:26. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I
put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and

<p><b>Eph. 4:24. Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness
and true holiness.</b></p>

<p><b>Gal. 5:22. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>225. In what does this new life really consist?</i></p></div>

<p>In consists in love to God who first loved us.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>226. By what means is the New Birth accomplished?</i></p></div>

<p>In little children it is accomplished by water
and the Spirit in baptism; but in those who
have fallen from the grace of their baptism, also
by the Word of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 3:5. Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
of God.</b></p>

<p><b>1 Peter 1:23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>227. Is the New Birth necessary to our salvation?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes, indeed; except a man be born anew, he
cannot see the kingdom of God. John 3: 3. [R. V.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 3:6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>228. What does the Holy Spirit further work in the believer?</i></p></div>

<p>He sanctifies and preserves him.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>229. What is Sanctification?</i></p></div>

<p>Sanctification is the gracious work of the
Holy Spirit whereby He day by day renews the
believer more and more after the image of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>230. How is the daily renewal accomplished?</i></p></div>

<p>The old man, or sin, is put away more and
more, and the new man, or the new spiritual
life, appears more and more in all our conduct.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Eph. 4:22&ndash;24. [R. V.] Put away, as concerning your former manner
of life, the old man, which waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;</b></p>

<p><b>And be ye renewed in the spirit of your mind,</b></p>

<p><b>And put on the new man, which after God hath been created in righteousness
and holiness of truth.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>231. How does this new conduct appear in the daily life of
a Christian?</i></p></div>

<p>A Christian denies himself, strives against
the devil, the world, and his own flesh; he grows
in love toward God and man, and seeks to do
the will of God in all things.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 16:24. If any man will come after me, let him deny himself,

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>232. Is the believer, then, justified and saved by his own good
works?</i></p></div>

<p>No; our best works avail nothing to this
end: we must build our hope of salvation on
Christ alone and His righteousness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Luk. 17:10. When ye shall have done all these things which are commanded

<p>Preservation is the gracious work of the

Jesus, until the end.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Phil. 1:6. [R. V.] He which began a good work in you will perfect it

<p>By the Word of God and the Lord's Supper.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>235. How does the Holy Spirit preserve the believer?</i></p></div>

<p>He teaches and guides, corrects and comforts
him.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>236. What are they called whom the Holy Spirit thus sanctifies
and preserves in faith?</i></p></div>

<p>They are called the children of God; the
Elect of God; Holy and Beloved; Members of the
Body of Christ. In a body they make up the
holy Christian church.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>237. What is the holy Christian church?</i></p></div>

according to the ordinance of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>238. Why is the church called holy?</i></p></div>

<p>The church is called holy because of the indwelling
of the Holy Spirit, who performs His
sanctifying work in all its members. For this
reason the church is called holy, in spite of its
sins and shortcomings.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Peter 2:9. Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who
hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>239. Why is the church called universal?</i></p></div>

<p>The church is called universal because its
object is to gather all nations, and because it
includes all true believers of all times and all
places.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>240. What is the state of the church on earth?</i></p></div>

<p>The church of God on earth is militant.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>241. Who are the enemies of the church?</i></p></div>

<p>The enemies of the church are the devil, the
world, and our own flesh. Its last enemy is
death.</p>

<p>It will be triumphant, because all its enemies
are conquered.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>243. Is the holy Christian church found in this place?</i></p></div>

<p>Hypocrites are they who indeed make outward

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>249. What precious gift does the Holy Spirit bestow upon us

<p>In this Christian church He daily forgives
me and all believers all our sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>250. But does a sanctified person need the forgiveness of sins
every day?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; because sanctification is never perfected
in this life, and sin cleaves to a Christian as

his sins to God, and earnestly seeks the
grace of God in Christ.</p>

<h3>PART THREE.</h3>
<h2>THE LORD'S PRAYER.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>265. What is prayer?</i></p></div>

<p>Prayer is the child-like communion of our
hearts with God, in which we tell Him all our
needs, and earnestly seek some gift from Him.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>266. Who should pray?</i></p></div>

<p>All should pray; even little children.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>267. But can all pray in this manner?</i></p></div>

<p>No, not the impenitent; their hearts are not
right with God, and they do not seek Him earnestly.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>268. In whose name must we pray?</i></p></div>

<p>We must pray in the name of Jesus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 16:23. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask
the Father in my name, he will give it you.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>269. What is meant by praying in the name of Jesus?</i></p></div>

<p>To pray in the name of Jesus is to ask on
the strength of what He has done for us, and
His intercession with the Father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>270. How should we pray?</i></p></div>

<p>We should pray humbly, confidently as a
child, and reverently.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>271. When should we pray?</i></p></div>

<p>The attitude of our hearts should be one of
constant prayer, and our communion with God
should not be confined to certain times and places,
but we should speak with Him whenever
we feel the need of it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Thess. 5:17. Pray without ceasing.</b></p>

<p><b>Eph. 6: 18. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the
Spirit.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>272. For whom should we pray?</i></p></div>

<p>We should pray not only for ourselves, but
also for others,&mdash;even our enemies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Tim. 2:1&ndash;3. Matt. 5:44.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>273. For what should we pray?</i></p></div>

<p>First of all we should pray for the spiritual
gifts necessary to our salvation; but we may
also pray for other gifts, both spiritual and
temporal.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 6:33. Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness;
and all these things shall be added unto you.</b></p>

<p><b>1 Cor. 12:31. Covet earnestly the best gifts.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>274. What must we always remember when we pray for
things not necessary to our salvation?</i></p></div>

<p>We must always remember that God alone
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
knows whether such a prayer answered would
truly benefit us.</p>

<p>When asking such gifts we should always
add, "Lord, if Thou wilt".</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 26:39. Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>275. Who teaches us to pray well?</i></p></div>

<p>The Holy Spirit, who is also called the Spirit
of prayer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 8:26. We know not what we should pray for as we ought: but
the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be
uttered.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>276. Which is the most perfect prayer?</i></p></div>

<p>The most perfect prayer is the Lord's Prayer,
which Christ taught His own disciples.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>277. Repeat this prayer.</i></p></div>

<p>Our Father, who art in heaven; hallowed
be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be
done on earth, as it is in heaven; give us this
day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who trespass against
us; and lead us not into temptation; but deliver
us from evil; for Thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>278. Why would God have us speak to Him as "Our Father"?</i></p></div>

<p>God would hereby tenderly invite us to believe
that He is truly our Father, and we are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
truly His children, so that we may ask of Him
with all cheerfulness and confidence, as dear
children ask of their dear father.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>279. Who alone can confidently call God Father?</i></p></div>

<p>God's children alone can call God their Father.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>280. Why would God have us say "our Father" and not only
"my Father"?</i></p></div>

<p>Because He would have us pray with one
another and for one another, in spiritual fellowship.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>281. What is the importance of the words "who art in
heaven"?</i></p></div>

<p>By these words we are reminded of the exalted
love and power of our heavenly Father,
far above that of any earthly father.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 7:11. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto
your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good
things to them that ask him?</b></p></div>

taught, and when we as the children of God
live holy lives in obedience to the Word. This

<p>But he that teaches and lives otherwise than
the Word of God teaches, profanes the name of
God among us. From this preserve us, heavenly
Father!</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>282. What do you pray for in the first petition?</i></p></div>

<p>I pray that the name of God may be hallowed

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>284. When do we hallow the name of God among our fellow
men?</i></p></div>

<p>We hallow the name of God when we freely
confess it before men in accordance with the
Word, and when we as God's children live holy
lives in obedience to the Word.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 5:16. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</b></p>

will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</b></p></div>

the Word of God teaches, profanes the name of
God.</p>

<p><b>Thy kingdom come.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>The kingdom of God comes indeed of itself,
without our prayer, but we pray in this petition
that it may come also to us.</p>

<p>This is done when our heavenly Father gives
us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe
the Word of God, and live holy and Christ-like
lives here in time, and in heaven forever.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>286. What do you pray for in the second petition?</i></p></div>

<p>I pray that the kingdom of God may come.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>287. What is meant, in a particular sense, by the kingdom
of God which you pray for in this petition?</i></p></div>

<p>1. The kingdom of grace, in which Christ
makes every believer a partaker of righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit; and</p>

<p>2. The kingdom of glory in heaven, where
the chosen live with Christ in perfect happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>288. What is meant by saying that the kingdom of God comes
to us?</i></p></div>

<p>It means that we become partakers in it.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>289. When does the kingdom of God come to us?</i></p></div>

<p>The kingdom of God comes to us when our
heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so
that by His grace we believe the Word of God.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>290. What does the Holy Spirit work in them who thus by
faith have become partakers in the kingdom of God?</i></p></div>

all evil plans and purposes of the devil, the
world, and our own flesh, that would hinder
the hallowing of His name and the coming of
His kingdom.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is the good and gracious

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>That is</i>,</p></div>

<p>We pray in this petition that our Father in
heaven would not look upon our sins, nor, on
account of them, deny our prayer; for we are
not worthy of anything we ask, neither have
we deserved it; but we pray that He would
give it to us out of His mercy; for we sin every
day, and deserve nothing but punishment.</p>

<p>Yes; Jesus Christ has paid for all our sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>307. Why must the believer ask the forgiveness of sins every

<p>Because he sins every day, and is always in

<p>God indeed tempts no one, but we pray in
this petition that He would guard and keep us

<p>By temptation is meant opportunities that
invite to sin.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>312. Does God give us such opportunities in order that we
may sin?</i></p></div>

<p>By no means; God, who is holy and loving,
does not tempt any one to sin.</p>

to His will.</p>

knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</b></p></div>

<h2>THE SACRAMENTS.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>333. What is a sacrament?</i></p></div>

<p>A sacrament is a holy ordinance made by
God Himself, in which He gives and confirms
His invisible grace through outward and visible

<h3>PART FOUR.</h3>
<h2>THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><i>335. What is Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Baptism is not water alone, but it is water
comprehended in God's command, and united
with His Word.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>336. What is God's command concerning Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>It is given in the words of Christ in the last
chapter of Matthew:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
    "<b>All power is given unto me in heaven and in
earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe
all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and,
lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world.</b>"</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>337. In whose name then are you baptized?</i></p></div>

<p>I am baptized in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>338. Explain this further.</i></p></div>

<p>In Baptism I have entered into fellowship
with the triune God, the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost; I have become His own, and
have been made heir of all His gracious gifts.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>339. Is the baptism of little children in agreement with Christ's
command?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; Christ Himself has said: "Suffer the
little children to come unto me, and forbid them
not: for of such is the kingdom of God."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Mark 10:14. John 3:5.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>340. Who should administer Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Baptism should be administered by the minister
of the church, but when necessary it may
be administered by any Christian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>341. What benefit do we have from Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Baptism works the forgiveness of sins, delivers
from death and the devil, and gives everlasting
life to all who believe what the Word
and promise of God declare.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>342. What is God's promise concerning Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>It is given in the words of Christ in the
sixteenth chapter of Mark:</p>

<p>"<b>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved;
but he that believeth not shall be condemned.</b>"</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>343. How does Baptism save us from sin, death, and the
devil?</i></p></div>

<p>In Baptism we come into fellowship with
Christ, and are made partakers in His redemption.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Gal. 3:27. As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put
on Christ.</b></p>

<p><b>Rom. 6:3, 4.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>344. How can water do such great things?</i></p></div>

<p>It is not water indeed that does it, but the
Word of God, which is in and with the water,
and faith which trusts this Word of God in the
water.</p>

<p>For without the Word of God, the water
is water alone, and no Baptism. But with the
Word of God it is a Baptism, that is, a gracious
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
water of life and a washing of regeneration in
the Holy Ghost.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Titus 3:5&ndash;7. According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</b></p>

<p><b>Which He shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior;</b></p>

<p><b>That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to
the hope of eternal life.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>345. Why is Baptism called the "washing of regeneration"?</i></p></div>

<p>Because the Holy Spirit in Baptism cleanses
us from sin, and gives us a new spiritual life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Pet. 3:21. Baptism is not the putting away of the filth of the flesh,
but the answer of a good conscience toward God, by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>346. Is not Baptism also called a covenant?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; Baptism is a covenant; in Baptism God
gives us a new life and His grace, and we promise
Him to renounce the devil, and all His works,
and all his ways, and to believe in the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>347. Who enjoy the blessings that God promises in Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>All who remain in the covenant of their
Baptism.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>348. When does he who was baptized as a child confirm the
covenant of his Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>At his confirmation, when he renews the
covenant of his Baptism in the midst of the assembled
congregation, having first been instructed
in God's Word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>349. Is it possible to remain in the covenant of Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; by the grace of God it is possible.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Phil. 4:13. I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>350. What must we do to remain in the grace of our Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>We must watch and pray, and make diligent
use of the Word of God and the Lord's
Supper.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>351. In what ways may we break the covenant of our Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>1. When we little by little forget our covenant,
resist the Holy Spirit, and neglect prayer,
so that we become more and more worldly-minded.</p>

<p>2. When we fall in coarse and open sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>352. Will not God again receive us when we have broken the
covenant of our Baptism?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; God has not broken His part of the
covenant, and when we again turn to Him, He
is always glad to receive us.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Luke 15:20. He arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet
a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell
on his neck, and kissed him.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>353. How does a repentant sinner get courage to return to
God?</i></p></div>

<p>He gets courage from considering the tender
Gospel invitation of Christ, and from seeking
God in prayer.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 11:28. Come unto me, all that labor and are heavy laden, and
I will give you rest.</b></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>354. Does not also he who remains true to the covenant of
his Baptism need repentance?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; he needs daily repentance and daily renewal.
<b>See 250.</b></p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>355. What does the baptizing with water signify?</i></p></div>

<p>It signifies that the old man in us should,
by daily sorrow and repentance, be drowned
and die, with all sins and evil desires; and again
a new man daily appear more and more, who
shall live before God in righteousness and purity
forever.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>356. What is meant by saying that the old man in us should
die, and the new man appear more and more?</i></p></div>

<p>Sin should be rooted out from us through
daily sorrow and repentance, and our love to
God and man should grow up within us more
and more, so that it may appear in all our conduct
that we have the mind of Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Rom. 6:4. We are buried with Christ by baptism into death: that like
as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we
also should walk in newness of life.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>357. What are the duties of sponsors?</i></p></div>

<p>They should pray for the child whose baptism
they have witnessed, they should remember
the covenant of their own Baptism, and afterwards,
as far as possible, see that the child is
brought up in the fear of God.</p>

<h3>PART FIVE.</h3>
<h2>THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>358. What is the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>It is the true body and blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ, under bread and wine, instituted
by Christ Himself for Christians to eat and to
drink.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>359. Repeat the Words of Institution.</i></p></div>

<p>"<b>Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the night in which
He was betrayed, took bread, and when He had given
thanks, He brake it and gave it to his disciples, saying,
Take, eat; this is my body, which is given for
you; this do in remembrance of me.</b></p>

<p>"<b>After the same manner, also, when He had supped,
He took the cup, and when He had given thanks, He
gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; this cup
is the New Testament in my blood, which is shed for
you, and for many, for the remission of sins; this do,
as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</b>"</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>360. When did Jesus institute the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>In the night in which He was betrayed to
death; it is therefore called the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>361. Is it important to note the time when Jesus instituted
the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; for it shows the loving care of our Savior,
who just before His suffering and death
thought more of us than of Himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>362. What do we receive in the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>In and with the bread and the wine we receive
the body and blood of Christ, which He
gave up in death for us.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>363. How do you know this?</i></p></div>

<p>Christ says concerning the bread: "Take,
eat; this is my body."</p>

<p>Concerning the wine He says: "Drink ye all
of it; this cup is the New Testament in my blood."</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>364. What is meant by "New Testament" in this connection?</i></p></div>

<p>Thereby is meant the new covenant which
God has made and sealed with the blood of Jesus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 10:16. The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion
of the body of Christ?</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>365. What, therefore, makes the bread and the wine a sacrament
of the body and blood of Christ?</i></p></div>

<p>God's own Word which is added to the
bread and the wine; for as Luther says, "Bread
and wine alone are but bread and wine; but
being united with the Word of God, they are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
truly the body and blood of Christ. For as the
mouth of Christ speaks, so it is; He can neither
lie nor deceive."</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>366. For whom is the Lord's Supper intended?</i></p></div>

<p>The Lord's Supper is intended for true Christians,
who are of age and understanding to prove

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 11: 28. [R. V.] Let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of
the bread, and drink of the cup.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>367. What benefit do we have from the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>It is shown by these words: "Given and
shed for you, for the remission of sins;" namely,
that in the sacrament forgiveness of sins, life,
and salvation are given us through these words.
For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is
also life and salvation.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>368. But does not the believer have the forgiveness of sins before
he partakes of the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; the believer has the forgiveness of sins
through Baptism and the Word.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>369. How, then, can the forgiveness of sins in a particular
sense be connected with this sacrament?</i></p></div>

<p>Because in the Lord's Supper we receive the
body and blood of Christ, which were offered
up for us, as a sure pledge of the forgiveness
of sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>370. In what way does the believer get life and salvation
through this sacrament?</i></p></div>

<p>Through this sacrament the believer is brought
into spiritual fellowship with his Lord and Savior,
who imparts Himself to him and thus preserves
and strengthens him in faith, hope, and
love unto eternal life.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>John 6: 56. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth
in me, and I in him.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>371. Does not the sacrament of the Lord's Supper also bring
about a more intimate fellowship between believers?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; believers are united in a closer fellowship
through partaking in common of the Lord
Jesus and eternal life in Him.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 10:17. For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we
are all partakers of that one bread.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>372. How can bodily eating and drinking do such great
things?</i></p></div>

<p>It is not the eating and drinking, indeed, that
does it, but the words which stand here: "Given
and shed for you, for the remission of sins."
These words, together with the bodily eating
and drinking, are the chief thing in the sacrament;
and He that believes these words, has
what they say and mean, namely, the forgiveness
of sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>373. Is it of little importance how we receive the Lord's
Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>By no means; we must be prepared when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
we go to partake of these gifts. It is much
worse to go to the Lord's Supper unprepared and
unworthily than not to go at all.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>374. Who, then, receive this sacrament worthily?</i></p></div>

<p>Fasting and bodily preparation are indeed
a good outward practise;</p>

<p>But he alone is truly worthy and well prepared,
who believes these words: "Given and shed
for you, for the remission of sins."</p>

<p>But he who believes not these words is unworthy
and unprepared. The words, "<b>for you</b>"
require truly believing hearts.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>375. Who, then, is rightly prepared to partake of the Lord's
Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>He who believes these words: "Given and
shed for you, for the remission of sins."</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>376. What is meant by "believing" these words?</i></p></div>

<p>Thereby is meant that we heartily feel our
sin and unworthiness before God, but also that
we confidently accept for ourselves the grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>377. Who partake of the Lord's Supper unworthily?</i></p></div>

<p>They who do not feel nor repent their sins,
and who do not from their heart believe in
Jesus.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 11:29. He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and
drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</b></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>378. Why do such unconverted persons partake of the Lord's
Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>They do so either from custom or habit, or
because they are ashamed to neglect the Lord's
Supper, or again because they mean to please
God by this outward obedience.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>379. Should such persons be admitted to the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>No.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt 7:6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
your pearls before swine.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>380. What must we do in order that we may not partake of
the Lord's Supper unworthily?</i></p></div>

<p>We must prayerfully search our own hearts
as in the presence of God, whether we repent
our sins and believe in Jesus Christ, and whether
we have an honest purpose to abstain from even
our bosom sins.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 11:28.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>381. How often should we partake of the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>Christ has not told us how often we should
partake, but He has said, "This do, as often as
ye drink it, in remembrance of me".</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>382. What should move us to partake of the Lord's Supper
often?</i></p></div>

<p>First of all, the command and promise of
our Lord and Savior; then, our own great need,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
which is the reason for our Father's tender invitation
and promise of grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>383. What are the common causes for the neglect of the Lord's
Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>Spiritual dullness and indifference, a worldly
mind, pride, and disregard for God's grace and
ordinance.</p>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>384. Should the feeling of our own unworthiness keep us
away from the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>No; the more we feel our own unworthiness,
and the more we sincerely long for God's forgiveness,
the more worthy are we to receive His
grace.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 5:3. Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.</b></p>

<p><b>1 Pet. 5:5. God giveth grace to the humble.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>385. What must we do when we receive the Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>We must remember our Savior and His death.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Luke 22:19. This do in remembrance of me.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>386. How should we remember Christ's death?</i></p></div>

<p>We should earnestly fix our mind upon the
suffering and death of Christ, so that we may
be strengthened in faith and in love to Him,
who loved us unto death.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Cor. 11:26. As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
show the Lord's death till He come.</b></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>387. What should be our conduct when we have received the
Lord's Supper?</i></p></div>

<p>We should quietly think of the great love
which God has shown us, and heartily thank
Him for it; not only for a few days, but always,
keep near to Jesus, show His death in
word and act, and in a sanctified life prove
that the body and blood of Christ have power to
cleanse from sin.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>1 Pet. 2:24. Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the
tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto rigtheousness: by whose
stripes ye were healed.</b></p></div>

<div class="blockquot section"><p><i>388. Is he who thus believes and lives in fellowship with
Christ sure to be saved?</i></p></div>

<p>Yes; when he continues steadfast in faith
until death.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Matt. 24:13. He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be
saved.</b></p>

of life.</b></p></div>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
